### Branch creation

To keep our repository organized and make collaboration easier, please follow these guidelines when creating and naming branches:

Use a consistent prefix to indicate the type of work:

* feature/ for new features

* bugfix/ for bug fixes

* hotfix/ for urgent or critical fixes

* release/ for release preparation

* docs/ for documentation updates

Example: 
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-user-authentication
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-error
git checkout -b docs/update-contributing-guide
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

```
Sticking to these conventions helps everyone quickly understand the purpose of each branch and keeps our workflow efficient

### Pull requests

When your changes are ready, submit a pull request (PR) to propose merging your branch into the main repository. Please follow these steps:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```
2. Open a pull request on GitHub: 

* Navigate to the main repository on GitHub.

* Click "Compare & pull request" next to your branch.

* Ensure the base branch is main (or the appropriate target branch).

3. Fill out the pull request template:

* Provide a clear title and description.

* List the main changes and the motivation behind them.
